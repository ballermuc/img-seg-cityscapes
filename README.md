## Project Overview
Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves classifying each pixel in an image into a specific category. This project focuses on semantic segmentation in the context of autonomous driving, utilizing models such as U-Net and DeepLabV3+ trained on the Cityscapes dataset.
